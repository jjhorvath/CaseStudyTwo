# CaseStudyTwo
Repo for Case Study two for the class Doing Data Science.

CaseStudyTwo.csv -- The dataset we originally loaded and the basis for all of the research and exploratory data analysis done for DDSAnalytics.

NewParameterNames.csv -- a list of old variable names and the new variable names we changed them too.  We changed them for better spacing throughout the report as well as easier understanding of the variables.

CaseStudyTwo.rmd -- The RMarkdown file that contains all of our code for the conclusions we have drawn.

CaseStudyTwo.html -- The HTML version of the output that the RMarkdown file outputs when knitted.

CaseStudyTwoCodebook.html -- The HTML version of a codebook autogenerated by RStudio in our RMarkdown.
